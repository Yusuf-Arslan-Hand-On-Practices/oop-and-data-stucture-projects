In student class,
We have id, name, last name, score as data fields.

equals method is overridden in student class to compare two students by id.
compareTo method is overridden in student class to compare two students by score, if scores are equal then compares name, last lame.

First, number of students asked to the user, then the student array created by this number, however,
user can terminate the loop with -1 either, so, I had to keep track of the number of elements by a counter.

After loop is finished, the array sorted with selection sort by using compareTo method of student.
Then, it is printed to the screen.

After that, duplicated students removed from the array by setting the duplicate elements to null.

Then, mean, median and standrat deviation calculated and printed to the screen.

Finally, removed students are printed to the screen.
