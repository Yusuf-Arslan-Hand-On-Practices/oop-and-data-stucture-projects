We have a folder names 'namefile' which includes baby name and their ranks from 2001 to 2021.
In NameRanking class, by reading these files, I created ArrayList of name and ranks for each year.
Then by asking the user, I printed the name and rank of the year that user wants. Or,
if there is not such a name, printed a warning message.
