In my Implementation, I created 3 classes, one for Flight, one for Itinerary, and one for 
the test class which has the list of flights and the Itinerary.

There is two main functionality, one is to find the Total Travel Time in minutes, which 
finds the first flight that departs from the origin, and the last flight that
arrives at the destination.

The other function is finds the total Flight Time in minutes.
It finds total time by adding the flight time of each flight in the itinerary.
