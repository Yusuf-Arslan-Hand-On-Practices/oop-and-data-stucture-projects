# OOP, Data Structure and Functional Programming Projects

This repository showcases the projects that I have completed outside of my CS coursework. Some of these projects, such as the Quad Tree and various AVL tree implementations, have helped me deepen my understanding of concepts that I had only briefly encountered in school.

Occasionally, I also worked on projects in C language to refresh my previous knowledge. Additionally, in addition to taking the CSE 222 Data Structure course in Java, I developed some projects using C++ language. This allowed me to revisit and solidify my understanding of C++, as well as gain exposure to new concepts.
